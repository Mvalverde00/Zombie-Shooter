# Zombie-Shooter

This project is meant to eventually result in an endless, wave-based Zombie shoot-em-up game; for now, it is just a man running around an empty map.  The primary purpose, however, is not to make a finished game, but rather to learn and apply the Entity-Component-System Design Pattern using the EnTT implementation.
